# due-process
A game about justice, integrity, and of course, due process

## Game

- Manage a number of prison cells, and their prisoners
- Regular inflow of prisoners
- With insufficient space over time, must make room for new prisoners
  - Manual execution - has a cooldown, axe grinding takes time!
  - Incite prison brawls
- Some prisoner types have positive or negative effects with other types
- Too positive, you cause a riot. Too negative, you will be investigated/audited.

## Premise

The Kingdom of Fecea is asphyxiating from the nauseating fumes of crime, bankruptcy, and moral degeneracy.

Brigands, highway robbers, and non-humans frustrate the attempts of the Kingdom's law enforcement to maintain order.

## Prisoner Types

The Kingdom of Fecea hosts many varieties of outlaw, including
- Orcs - have a taste for hobbit-flesh
- Hobbits - clever in numbers
- Rebels - hate the bourgeosie usurpers
- Usurpers - bribe the guards
- Elves - hate the conniving goblins
- Goblins - clever in numbers
